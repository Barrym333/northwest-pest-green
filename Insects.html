    <p><b>Many unwelcome animals visit or make their home in residential buildings,
         industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers,
          chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss,
           others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance.
            Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control,
             modifying the habitat, and using repellents , growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides</b></p><br>

<h2 class="sub-title">Ants</h2>
<p><b>In the UK, there are several species of ants, with some being more common than others.
    Heres an overview of the most notable ones:</b></p>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Black Garden Ant (Lasius niger)</h2>
    
<p><b>: The most common ant in the UK, often found in gardens and homes.</b></p>
<p><b>: Typically black or dark brown and around 3–5mm in length.</b></p>
<p><b>: Lives in large colonies, often nesting under patios, pavements, or in garden soil.</b></p>
<p><b>: Attracted to sweet foods and can become a household nuisance.</b></p><br>


<h2 class="sub-title">Red Ant (Myrmica rubra)</h2>
<p><b>: Also known as the European fire ant, these ants are reddish-brown.</b></p>
<p><b>: Can deliver a mild sting when disturbed.</b></p>
<p><b>: Nests are usually found in soil, under rocks, or in decaying wood.</b></p><br>



<h2 class="sub-title">Wood Ant (Formica rufa)</h2>

<p><b>: Larger than common garden ants, reaching up to 10mm in length.</b></p>
<p><b>: Typically reddish-brown with a dark abdomen.</b></p>
<p><b>: Builds large, visible mounds in forests made from twigs, leaves, and pine needles.</b></p>
<p><b>: Plays an important ecological role in woodland environments.</b></p><br>
     
<h2 class="sub-title">Pharaoh Ant (Monomorium pharaonis)</h2>

<p><b>: A small, yellow-brown species that prefers warm, indoor environments.</b></p>
<p><b>: Often found in hospitals, kitchens, and heated buildings.</b></p>
<p><b>: Difficult to control due to their ability to form multiple colonies.</b></p><br>

<h2 class="sub-title">Ghost Ant (Tapinoma melanocephalum)</h2>

<p><b>: Very small, with a dark head and pale, almost translucent body.</b></p>
<p><b>: Prefers warm and humid environments, often nesting in walls or behind kitchen appliances.</b></p>
<p><b>: Attracted to sweet and greasy foods.</b></p><br>



<h2 class="sub-title">Ant Behaviour in the UK</h2>

<p><b>: Most ants are social insects, living in colonies with a queen, workers, and, at certain times, flying reproductive ants.</b></p>
<p><b>: Flying ants" appear during summer (usually in July or August) when reproductive males and queens swarm to mate.</b></p>
<p><b>: They primarily feed on sugary substances, plant nectar, dead insects, and food scraps.</b></p><br>

<h2 class="sub-title">Problems Caused by Ants</h2>

<p><b>: While most UK ants are harmless, they can become a nuisance when they invade homes.</b></p>
<p><b>: Some species, like Pharaoh ants, can spread bacteria in kitchens and healthcare settings.</b></p>
<p><b>: Wood ants can bite, but their bites are not harmful to humans.</b></p><br>

<h2 class="sub-title">Wasp</h2>
<p><b>In the UK, the term "wasp" usually refers to social wasps from the Vespidae family,
particularly the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris) and the German wasp (Vespula germanica).
These wasps are known for their black and yellow striped bodies and can become
a nuisance, especially in late summer when they search for sugary foods.</b></p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Types of Wasps in the UK</h2>


<p><b><u>Common Wasp (Vespula vulgaris) – The most frequently encountered species, nesting underground or in sheltered areas.</b></p></u>
<p><b><u>German Wasp (Vespula germanica) – Similar to the common wasp but slightly larger, with three black dots on its face.</b></p></u>
<p><b><u>European Hornet (Vespa crabro) – A larger, less aggressive wasp with a brown and yellow body.</b></p></u>
<p><b><u>Tree Wasp (Dolichovespula sylvestris) – Builds aerial nests and can be more aggressive.</b></p></u>
<p><b><u>Median Wasp (Dolichovespula media) – A relatively new species in the UK, often mistaken for a hornet.</b></p></u>
<p><b><u>Asian Hornet (Vespa velutina) – An invasive species posing a threat to bees and biodiversity.</b></p></u>

<h2 class="sub-title">Lifecycle</h2>

<p><b>: Spring – Queens emerge from hibernation, build nests, and lay eggs.</b></p>
<p><b>: Summer – Worker wasps hatch and take over foraging while the queen focuses on reproduction.</b></p>
<p><b>: Autumn – Wasps become more aggressive as food sources decline, often invading picnics and homes.</b></p>
<p><b>: Winter – Colonies die off, leaving only fertilized queens to hibernate.</b></p>


<h2 class="sub-title">Are Wasps Dangerous?</h2>

<p><b>: Wasps can sting multiple times and may become aggressive, especially if their nest is disturbed.
Some people may suffer severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) from stings.</b></p>
<p><b><u>Do Wasps Have Benefits?</b></p></u>
<p><b>: Yes! Wasps are essential pollinators and natural pest controllers, feeding on caterpillars, aphids, and other insects.</b></p>
