    <p><b>Many unwelcome animals visit or make their home in residential buildings,
         industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers,
          chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss,
           others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance.
            Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control,
             modifying the habitat, and using repellents , growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides</b></p><br>

   <h2 class="sub-title">Fleas</h2>

   <p><b>Fleas are external parasites, living off the blood of mammals and birds, and include cat/dog fleas, human fleas and rat fleas.
     Beside the problems posed by the flea itself, they can also act as a vector for disease, for example,
      they can transmit a variety of viral and bacterial diseases to humans and other animals.
       Cat/dog fleas are not thought to transmit any serious illness to humans but they can cause severe irritation.</b></p>

      Fleas in the UK

      Fleas are small, wingless, parasitic insects that feed on the blood of animals and humans. They are a common problem in UK homes, especially for pet owners, as they can quickly infest carpets, furniture, and bedding.
      
      Common UK Flea Species
      
      1. Cat Flea (Ctenocephalides felis)
      
      The most common flea in the UK.
      
      Prefers cats but will also bite dogs and humans.
      
      Reddish-brown, about 1–3mm long, with powerful hind legs for jumping.
      
      
      
      2. Dog Flea (Ctenocephalides canis)
      
      Similar to cat fleas but more commonly found on dogs.
      
      Less common than cat fleas in the UK.
      
      
      
      3. Human Flea (Pulex irritans)
      
      Rare in modern homes but still found in some rural areas.
      
      Can infest humans, pigs, and other animals.
      
      
      
      4. Bird Fleas
      
      Found in bird nests and can enter homes when birds leave the nest.
      
      
      
      
      Where Are Fleas Found?
      
      On Pets – Fleas live on dogs and cats, especially around the neck, back, and tail.
      
      Carpets & Rugs – Flea eggs and larvae develop in soft furnishings.
      
      Furniture & Bedding – Fleas hide in sofas, pet beds, and blankets.
      
      Garden & Outdoor Areas – Fleas can survive in shaded areas where pets rest.
      
      
      Flea Life Cycle
      
      Eggs – Laid on the host but often fall into carpets and bedding.
      
      Larvae – Tiny worm-like larvae feed on organic debris and flea droppings.
      
      Pupae – Develop inside cocoons and can remain dormant for months.
      
      Adults – Fully developed fleas emerge when they sense warmth and movement.
      
      
      Signs of a Flea Infestation
      
      1. Pets Scratching – Excessive scratching, biting, or grooming.
      
      
      2. Flea Dirt – Small black specks (flea droppings) on pet fur or bedding.
      
      
      3. Flea Bites – Small red, itchy bites, often on ankles, legs, or waist.
      
      
      4. Seeing Fleas – Tiny, fast-moving insects in fur, carpets, or furniture.
      
      
      
      Health Risks of Fleas
      
      Skin irritation & allergies – Bites cause itching and rashes.
      
      Anemia in pets – Severe flea infestations can lead to blood loss in animals.
      
      Tapeworm transmission – Fleas can carry tapeworm larvae, which can infect pets and humans.
      
      
      How to Get Rid of Fleas
      
      Treat Pets – Use vet-approved flea treatments like spot-on treatments, flea collars, and oral medications.
      
      Vacuum Regularly – Clean carpets, furniture, and pet bedding frequently.
      
      Wash Bedding & Soft Furnishings – Wash pet beds, cushions, and blankets at 60°C to kill fleas.
      
      Use Flea Sprays & Powders – Apply insecticides to carpets, skirting boards, and pet areas.
      
      Professional Pest Control – For severe infestations, fumigation or professional heat treatments may be necessary.

<img src="wasp.jpg" alt="insects picture" class="round-image" height="200px" width="200px" > <br>

<p><b>Wasp nests are normally built in sheltered spots, with easy access to outside.
     They can be found in areas such as wall cavities, roof spaces and under eaves.
      They can grow to around the size of a football as the summer progresses.
       Only female wasps sting, but they can do so repeatedly. Honeybees live in colonies often greater than 30,000
        in roof and wall cavities, and hollow trees. They swarm in early summer.
         They have a barbed sting and die once this is used but will sting when provoked.
          Untreated infestations can cause contamination of food, harm to mortar and building fabric,
           and threats of stings. Some people may experience anaphylactic shock on being stung and will require prompt treatment.</b></p>

      Flies in the UK

      Flies are common insects in the UK, with various species found in homes, businesses, and outdoor spaces. While some are simply a nuisance, others can spread diseases by contaminating food and surfaces.
      
      Common Fly Species in the UK
      
      1. House Fly (Musca domestica)
      
      The most common fly found in homes and kitchens.
      
      About 6–7mm long, grey body, large red eyes, and transparent wings.
      
      Feeds on food waste and organic matter.
      
      Can spread bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli.
      
      
      
      2. Bluebottle Fly (Calliphora vomitoria)
      
      Larger than house flies (10–14mm), with a metallic blue body.
      
      Attracted to rotting food, waste, and dead animals.
      
      Common in bins, compost heaps, and near carcasses.
      
      
      
      3. Greenbottle Fly (Lucilia sericata)
      
      Similar to bluebottles but with a shiny green body.
