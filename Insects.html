    <p><b>Many unwelcome animals visit or make their home in residential buildings,
         industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers,
          chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss,
           others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance.
            Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control,
             modifying the habitat, and using repellents , growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides</b></p>

             <p><u><b>Ants</b></u></p>

             <p><b>In the UK, there are several species of ants, with some being more common than others.
                 Heres an overview of the most notable ones:</b></p>
                 <p><b><u>Black Garden Ant (Lasius niger)</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: The most common ant in the UK, often found in gardens and homes.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Typically black or dark brown and around 3–5mm in length.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Lives in large colonies, often nesting under patios, pavements, or in garden soil.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Attracted to sweet foods and can become a household nuisance.</b></p><br>
             
             <p><b><u>Red Ant (Myrmica rubra)</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: Also known as the European fire ant, these ants are reddish-brown.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Can deliver a mild sting when disturbed.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Nests are usually found in soil, under rocks, or in decaying wood.</b></p><br>
           



             <p><b><u>Wood Ant (Formica rufa)</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: Larger than common garden ants, reaching up to 10mm in length.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Typically reddish-brown with a dark abdomen.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Builds large, visible mounds in forests made from twigs, leaves, and pine needles.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Plays an important ecological role in woodland environments.</b></p><br>
                  
             <p><b><u>Pharaoh Ant (Monomorium pharaonis)</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: A small, yellow-brown species that prefers warm, indoor environments.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Often found in hospitals, kitchens, and heated buildings.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Difficult to control due to their ability to form multiple colonies.</b></p><br>
             
                  
             <p><b><u>Ghost Ant (Tapinoma melanocephalum)</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: Very small, with a dark head and pale, almost translucent body.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Prefers warm and humid environments, often nesting in walls or behind kitchen appliances.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Attracted to sweet and greasy foods.</b></p><br>
             



             <p><b><u>Ant Behaviour in the UK</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: Most ants are social insects, living in colonies with a queen, workers, and, at certain times, flying reproductive ants.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Flying ants" appear during summer (usually in July or August) when reproductive males and queens swarm to mate.</b></p>
             <p><b>: They primarily feed on sugary substances, plant nectar, dead insects, and food scraps.</b></p><br>
             
             
             <p><b><u>Problems Caused by Ants</b></p></u>
             <p><b>: While most UK ants are harmless, they can become a nuisance when they invade homes.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Some species, like Pharaoh ants, can spread bacteria in kitchens and healthcare settings.</b></p>
             <p><b>: Wood ants can bite, but their bites are not harmful to humans.</b></p><br>


             
             



                  <p><u><b>Bedbugs </b></u></p>

                  <p><b>Bedbugs are small, oval, brownish insects that live on the blood of animals or humans.
                     Adult bedbugs have flat bodies about the size of an apple seed. After feeding,
                      however, their bodies swell and are a reddish colour.
                       Bedbugs may enter your home undetected through luggage, clothing, used beds, sofas and other items.
                        Their flattened bodies make it possible for them to fit into tiny spaces, about the width of a credit card.
                         Bedbugs do not have nests like ants or bees, but tend to live in groups in hiding places.
                          Bedbugs live solely on blood. Having them in your home is not a sign of dirtiness,
                           you are as likely to find them in immaculate homes and hotel rooms as in filthy ones.</b></p>

<p><u><b>Cockroaches  </b></u></p>

<p><b>There are two types of cockroach found in the UK, the Oriental cockroach and the German cockroach.
     Cockroaches will feed on almost anything, from food to faecal matter.
      They are commonly found in kitchens and heating systems. They prefer warm moist conditions and they reproduce rapidly;
       a German cockroach can produce up to 240 eggs per month. They can spread bacteria and usually indicate that food preparation areas are not clean.
        Germs can be spread from the body of a cockroach or from their droppings. They can carry dysentery, 
        gastroenteritis, typhoid and food poisoning organisms. Contamination occurs when the cockroaches come into contact with food.</b></p>

   <p><u><b>Fleas  </b></u></p>

   <p><b>Fleas are external parasites, living off the blood of mammals and birds, and include cat/dog fleas, human fleas and rat fleas.
     Beside the problems posed by the flea itself, they can also act as a vector for disease, for example,
      they can transmit a variety of viral and bacterial diseases to humans and other animals.
       Cat/dog fleas are not thought to transmit any serious illness to humans but they can cause severe irritation.</b></p>

<p><u><b>Wasps and bees   </b></u></p>

<p><b>Wasp nests are normally built in sheltered spots, with easy access to outside.
     They can be found in areas such as wall cavities, roof spaces and under eaves.
      They can grow to around the size of a football as the summer progresses.
       Only female wasps sting, but they can do so repeatedly. Honeybees live in colonies often greater than 30,000
        in roof and wall cavities, and hollow trees. They swarm in early summer.
         They have a barbed sting and die once this is used but will sting when provoked.
          Untreated infestations can cause contamination of food, harm to mortar and building fabric,
           and threats of stings. Some people may experience anaphylactic shock on being stung and will require prompt treatment.</b></p>
