<p><b>Treatment involves assessing the extent of the problem, laying baits or traps as necessary,
     checking the baits or traps regularly and removing the material at the end of the treatment.
      Rats are notoriously neophobic and may be reluctant to approach DIY bait stations.
       Our pest control operatives are experienced in identifying and locating runs and places of harbourage,
        and the placement and use of bait to overcome bait shyness.
         The use of rodenticide is Controlled by the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986.
          Sometimes more than one treatment will be required to ensure effective control.</b></p>

          <p><b><u>Squirrels</u></b></p>
          <p><b>The UK is home to two species of squirrels: the native red squirrel
             (Sciurus vulgaris) and the invasive grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis).</b></p>
          <img src="red squirrel.jpg" alt="Picture of a Red Squirrel" class="round-image">
          <p><b><u>Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris)</b></p></u>
          <p>: Size: 18-24 cm long, with a bushy tail around 15-20 cm</p>
          <p>: Weight: 250-350g</p>
          <p>: Appearance: Reddish-brown fur, tufted ears, white underside</p>
          <p>: Habitat: Coniferous and mixed forests, mostly in Scotland, parts of northern England, Wales, and some islands</p>
          <p>: Diet: Nuts, seeds, berries, fungi, and tree bark</p>
          <p>: Status: Declining due to habitat loss and competition from grey squirrels</p><br>

          <p><b><u>Grey Squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis)</b></p></u>
          <p>: Size: 25-30 cm long, with a tail around 22-25 cm</p>
          <p>: Weight: 400-600g</p>
          <p>: Appearance: Grey fur, white underside, no ear tufts</p>
          <p>: Habitat: Parks, gardens, and broadleaf woodlands across England, Wales, and parts of Scotland</p>
          <p>: Diet: Nuts, seeds, fruits, fungi, and bird eggs</p>
          <p>: Impact: Outcompetes red squirrels, spreads squirrelpox (fatal to reds), and causes tree damage</p><br>


          <p><b><u>Squirrel Problems in the UK</p></u></b>
          <p>: Ecological Impact: Grey squirrels have contributed to the red squirrels decline</p>
          <p>: Property Damage: Can chew through wires, insulation, and wooden structures in attics</p>
          <p>: Garden Nuisance: Dig up bulbs, raid bird feeders, and strip tree bark</p><br>


          <p><b>Following our survey, a baiting programme will be discussed with you to take into account the particular
             circumstances and location of the infestation.
