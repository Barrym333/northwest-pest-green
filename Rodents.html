<p><b>Our treatment process begins with a thorough assessment of the infestation,
     followed by the strategic placement of baits or traps as needed. These are regularly monitored,
      and all materials are safely removed at the end of the treatment.</b></p><br>

      <p><b>Rats are highly cautious of new objects, making DIY bait stations less effective.
         Our experienced pest control technicians are skilled in identifying rat runs and harbourage sites,
          ensuring bait is placed effectively to overcome bait shyness.</b></p><br>
   
         <p><b>The use of rodenticides is strictly regulated under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986,
